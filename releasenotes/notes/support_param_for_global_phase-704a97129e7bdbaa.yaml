    :class:`~qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit` supports parameterization for its `global_phase`.
    However, Aer has not allowed such parameterization and failed when transpiler generates
    parameterized global phases. This commit supports parameterization of `global_phase` and
    resolve issues related to https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-aer/issues/1795,
    https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-aer/issues/1781, and https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-aer/issues/1798.
