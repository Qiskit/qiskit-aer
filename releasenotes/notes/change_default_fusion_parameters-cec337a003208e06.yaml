    Set default ``fusion_max_qubit`` and ``fusion_threshold`` depending on `method`.
    Previously default values of ``fusion_max_qubit`` and ``fusion_threshold`` were 
    ``5`` and ``14`` respectively in any methods. However, their optimal values
    depend on running methods. This feature changes their default values depending
    on a configured method.
