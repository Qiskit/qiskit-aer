    If a circuit has conditional and parameters, the circuit was not be
    correctly simulated because parameter bindings of Aer used wrong positions
    to apply parameters. This is from a lack of consideration of bfunc operations
    injected by conditional. With this commit, parameters are set to correct
    positions with consideration of injected bfun operations.

    Parameters for global phases were not correctly set in #1814.
    https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-aer/pull/1814
    Parameter values for global phases were copied to a template circuit and not to
    actual circuits to be simulated. This commit correctly copies parameter values
    to circuits to be simulated.
