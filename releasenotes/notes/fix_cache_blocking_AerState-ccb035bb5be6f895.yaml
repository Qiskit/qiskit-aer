    This is a fix of AerState running with cache blocking. AerState wrongly configured
    transpiler of Aer for cache blocking, and then its algorithm to swap qubits
    worked wrongly. This fix corrects AerState to use this transpiler. More specifically,
    After the transpilation, a swapped qubit map is recoverd to the original map
    when using AerState. This fix is necessary for AerStatevector to use multiple-GPUs.
