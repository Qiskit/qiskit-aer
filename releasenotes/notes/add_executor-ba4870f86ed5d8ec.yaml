    This release restructures ``State`` classes.
    Adding circuit executor classes that runs a circuit and manages multiple
    states for multi-shots simulations or multi-chunk simulations for large
    number of qubits.
    Previously ``StateChunk`` class manages multiple chunks for multi-shots or
    multi-chunk simulations but now ``State`` class only has one state
    and all the parallelization codes are moved to ``Executor`` classes.
    Now all ``State`` classes are independent from parallelization.
    Also some of the functions in ``Aer::Controller`` class are moved to
    ``CircuitExecutor::Executor`` class.

    Shot-branching technique that decreases calculation of multi-shots
    simulation is implemented with restructured ``Executor`` classes.
    Shot-branching is currently applicable to statevector density matrix
    and tensor-network methods.
    By default ``shot_branching_enable`` is enabled.
    And by setting ``runtime_noise_sampling_enable``, noise sampling is
    done on the fly with shot-branching.
