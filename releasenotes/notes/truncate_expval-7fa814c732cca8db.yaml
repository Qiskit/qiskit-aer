    This fix truncates qubits of save_expval operation when EstimatorV2
    is made from existing backends using `from_backend`.
    By transpiling on the existing backends, ancilla qubits are filled
    to all the qubits that causes memory error on the simulator.
    So Aer removes unused qubits for save_expval operation.
