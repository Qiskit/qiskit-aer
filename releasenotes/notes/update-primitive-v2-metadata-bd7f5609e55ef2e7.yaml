    The metadata of Primitives V2 implementations,
    i.e., :class:`.SamplerV2` and :class:`.EstimatorV2`,
    has been updated to match that of IBM quantum devices.

    * ``version`` and ``circuit_metadata`` are added for :class:`.SamplerV2` and :class:`.EstimatorV2`
    * ``shots`` is added for :class:`.SamplerV2`

    Note that metadata of :class:`.EstimatorV2` does not have ``shots`` because
    the class computes expectation values with ``save_expectation_value`` instruction and shots are not used.
