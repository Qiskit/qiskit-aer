    Fixes bug with :class:`~qiskit.providers.aer.AerProvider` where options set
    on the returned backends using
    :meth:`~qiskit.providers.aer.QasmSimulator.set_options` were stored in the
    provider and would persist for subsequent calls to
    :meth:`~qiskit.providers.aer.AerProvider.get_backend` for the same named
    backend. Now every call to 
    and :meth:`~qiskit.providers.aer.AerProvider.backends` returns a new
    instance of the simulator backend that can be configured.
