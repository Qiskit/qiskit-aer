upgrade:
  - |
    Add option to ignore checking system memory availability against
    required memory if `max_memory_mb=-1` is set
fixes:
  - |
    Fixed required memory size for MPS method. Required memory was wrongly
    estimated because all the 2-qubits gates increased required memory,
    but only rxx, ryy and rzx gates (when theta is not multiple of pi/2)
    and unitary increase memory.
