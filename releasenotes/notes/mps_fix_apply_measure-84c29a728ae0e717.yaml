    Fixed issue <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-aer/issues/1694>.
    Changed the MPS measurement algorithm so that it does not move the qubits
    to the sorted positions before measuring. We measure the qubits in the
    order of the current MPS structure and then sort the measurement values
    as a post-process. Beside fixing the bug, this is expected to improve 
    performance and enable more accurate representation of entangled states.
