    Fixes a bug where ``NoiseModel.from_backend()`` prints verbose warnings when
    supplying a backend that reports un-physical device parameters such as T2 > 2 * T1
    due to statistical errors in their estimation.
    This commit removes such warnings because they are not actionable for users in the sense
    that there are no means other than truncating them to the theoretical bounds as
    done within ``noise.device`` module.
    See `Issue 1631 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-aer/issues/1631>`__
    for details of the fixed bug.
