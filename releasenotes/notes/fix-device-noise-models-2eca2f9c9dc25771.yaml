    Fixes a bug where :meth:`NoiseModel.from_backend` with a ``BackendV2`` object may generate
    a noise model with excessive ``QuantumError`` s on non-Gate instructions while,
    for example, only ``ReadoutError`` s should be sufficient for measures.
    This commit updates :func:`noise.device.models.basic_device_gate_errors`
    so that it (and hence :meth:`NoiseModel.from_backend`) does not produce
    any QuantumErrors on non-Gate objects (e.g. measures and resets).

    Noise models created from backend (via :meth:`NoiseModel.from_backend`) contains
    ``QuantumError`` s only on ``Gate`` instructions. That means they no longer contains
    errors on ``Reset`` instructions. Previously, they had relaxation errors on reset instructions.
    The change may affect users who use :meth:`NoiseModel.from_backend` with ``temperature > 0``
    while it should affect those who use with default value ``temperature = 0``.
    Note that they still have ``ReadoutError`` s on ``Measure`` instructions.
