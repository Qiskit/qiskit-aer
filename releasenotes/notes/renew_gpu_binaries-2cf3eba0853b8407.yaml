    Changed supported CUDA version for GPU simulator to 11.2 or higher. Previously qiskit-aer supported running
    with CUDA>=10.1, but now the minimum requirement is 11.2. This was required to leverage newer features in
    CUDA along with cuQuantum support. It also reflects changes made in Python packaging around the use of
    CUDA.
    Now GPU binaries are including cuQuantum support. There are separate
    binaries for CUDA 11 and 12. qiskit-aer-gpu-cu11 for CUDA 11 and
    qiskit-aer-gpu-cu12 for CUDA 12.
