    Qiskit Aer now requires CUDA version for GPU simulator to 11.2 or
    higher.  Previously, CUDA 10.1 was the minimum supported version.
    This change was necessary because of changes in the upstream CUDA
    ecosystem, including cuQuantum support. To support users running
    with different versions of CUDA there is now a separate package available
    for running with CUDA 11:  ``qiskit-aer-gpu-cu11`` and using the
    ``qiskit-aer-gpu`` package now requires CUDA 12. If you're an existing
    user of the ``qiskit-aer-gpu`` package and want to use CUDA 11
    you will need to run::
    
        pip uninstall qiskit-aer-gpu && pip install -U qiskit-aer-gpu-cu11
    
    to go from the previously CUDA 10.x compatible ``qiskit-aer-gpu``
    package's releases to upgrade to the new CUDA 11 compatible
    package. If you're running CUDA 12 locally already you can upgrade
    the ``qiskit-aer-gpu`` package as normal.
