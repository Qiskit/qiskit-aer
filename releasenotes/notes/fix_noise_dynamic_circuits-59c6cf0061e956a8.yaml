    When the circuit is a dynamic circuit, the input circuit was not correctly
    transpiled in AerCompiler that causes wrong noise simulation result,
    because some gates noise to be applied were transpiled to other gates.

    This fix uses custom pass manager to decompose only jump and mark ops
    Aer uses internally.
