    When the circuit is a dynamic circuit, the input circuit was not correctly
    transpiled in AerCompiler that causes wrong noise simulation result,
    because some gates noise to be applied were transpiled to other gates.

    Fixes AerCompiler to build basis_gates with input circuit, not to be transpiled
