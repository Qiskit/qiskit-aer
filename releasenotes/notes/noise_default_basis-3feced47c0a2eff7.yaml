    The default basis for the :class:`~qiskit.providers.aer.noise.NoiseModel`
    class has been changed from ``["id", "u3", "cx"]`` to
    ``["id", "rz", "sx", "cx"]`` due to the deprecation of the ``u3`` circuit
    method in qiskit-terra and change of qiskit-ibmq-provider backend basis
    gates. To use the old basis gates you can initialize a noise model with
    custom basis gates as ``NoiseModel(basis_gates=["id", "u3", "cx"])``.
