    CircuitExecutor::required_memory_mb was called multiple times in some cases
    that is not efficient for some simulation method.
    So CircuitExecutor::required_memory_mb is now called only once.

    State::set_config was not called before calling State::required_memory_mb.
    Extended stabilizer uses parameter from config to calculate required memory
    so size was not correct before this fix.

    State::required_memory_mb for MPS method returned wrong memory size.
    This fix adds memory size estimation by calculating max bond dimension.
