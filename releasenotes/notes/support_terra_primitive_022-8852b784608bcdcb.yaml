    Fixed compatibility of the  :class:`~.qiskit_aer.primitives.Sampler` and :class:`~.qiskit_aer.primtives.Estimator` 
    primitive classes with qiskit-terra 0.22.0 release. In qiskit-terra 0.22.0 breaking API changes were made to the
    abstract interface which broke compatibility with these classes, this has been addressed so that
    :class:`~.qiskit_aer.primitives.Sampler` and :class:`~.qiskit_aer.primtives.Estimator` can now be used with
    qiskit-terra >= 0.22.0.
