    Fixes a bug in the ``stabilizer`` simulator method of the
    :class:`~qiskit.providers.aer.QasmSimulator` and
    :class:`~qiskit.providers.aer.AerSimulator` where the expectation value
    for the ``save_expectation_value`` and ``snapshot_expectation_value``
    could have the wrong sign for certain ``Y`` Pauli's.
