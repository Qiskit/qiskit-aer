features:
  - |
    Added support for diagonal gates to the `"matrix_product_state"` simulation
    method.
  - |
    Added support for the ``initialize`` instruction to the
    `"matrix_product_state"` simulation method.
issues:
  - |
    There is a known issue where the simulation of certain circuits with a Kraus
    noise model using the `"matrix_product_state"` simulation method can cause
    the simulator to crash. Refer to
    `#306 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-aer/issues/1184>` for more
    information.
