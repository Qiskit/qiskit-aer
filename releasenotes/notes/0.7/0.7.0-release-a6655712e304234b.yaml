    This 0.7.0 release includes numerous performance improvements and
    significant enhancements to the simulator interface, and drops support
    for Python 3.5.
    The main interface changes are configurable simulator backends,
    and constructing preconfigured simulators from IBMQ backends.
    Noise model an basis gate support has also been extended for most of the
    Qiskit circuit library standard gates, including new support for 1 and 2-qubit
    rotation gates.
    Performance improvements include adding SIMD support to the density matrix
    and unitary simulation methods, reducing the used memory and improving the
    performance of circuits using statevector and density matrix snapshots, and
    adding support for Kraus instructions to the gate fusion circuit optimization
    for greatly improving the performance of noisy statevector simulations.
