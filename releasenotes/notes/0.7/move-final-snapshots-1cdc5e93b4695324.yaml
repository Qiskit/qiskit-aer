    Use move semantics for statevector and density matrix snapshots for the
    `"statevector"` and `"density_matrix"` methods of the
    :class:`~qiskit.providers.aer.QasmSimulator` if they are the final
    instruction in a circuit. This reduces the memory usage of the
    simulator improves the performance by avoiding copying a large array in 
    the results.
