    Add the CMake flag ``DISABLE_CONAN`` (default=``OFF``)s. When installing from source,
    setting this to ``ON`` allows bypassing the Conan package manager to find libraries
    that are already installed on your system. This is also available as an environment
    variable ``DISABLE_CONAN``, which takes precedence over the CMake flag.
    This is not the official procedure to build AER. Thus, the user is responsible
    of providing all needed libraries and corresponding files to make them findable to CMake.
