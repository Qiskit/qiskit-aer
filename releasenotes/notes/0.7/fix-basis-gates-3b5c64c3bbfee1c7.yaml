fixes:
  - |
    Fix bug where the `"sx"`` gate :class:`~qiskit.circuit.library.SXGate` was
    not listed as a supported gate in the C++ code, in `StateOpSet` of
    `matrix_product_state.hp`.
  - |
    Fix bug where ``"csx"``, ``"cu2"``, ``"cu3"`` were incorrectly listed as
    supported basis gates for the ``"density_matrix"`` method of the
    :class:`~qiskit.providers.aer.QasmSimulator`.
  - |
    Fix bug where parameters were passed incorrectly between functions in
    `matrix_product_state_internal.cpp`, causing wrong simulation, as well
    as reaching invalid states, which in turn caused an infinite loop.
