    Fixes issue with setting :class:`~qiskit.providers.aer.QasmSimulator`
    basis gates when using ``"method"`` and ``"noise_model"`` options
    together, and when using them with a simulator constructed using
    :meth:`~qiskit.providers.aer.QasmSimulator.from_backend`. Now the
    listed basis gates will be the intersection of gates supported by
    the backend configuration, simulation method, and noise model basis
    gates. If the intersection of the noise model basis gates and 
    simulator basis gates is empty a warning will be logged.
