    When invoking MPS::sample_measure, we need to first sort the qubits to the 
    default ordering because this is the assumption in qasm_controller.This is 
    done by invoking the method move_all_qubits_to_sorted_ordering. It was 
    correct in sample_measure_using_apply_measure, but missing in 
    sample_measure_using_probabilities.
