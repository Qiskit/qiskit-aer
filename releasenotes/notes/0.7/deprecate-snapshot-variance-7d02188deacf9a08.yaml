    The ``variance`` kwarg of Snapshot instructions has been deprecated. This
    function computed the sample variance in the snapshot due to noise model
    sampling, not the variance due to measurement statistics so was often
    being used incorrectly. If noise modeling variance is required single shot
    snapshots should be used so variance can be computed manually in
    post-processing.
