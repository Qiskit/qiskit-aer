    Added a new snapshot: `snapshot_amplitudes`. See PR #1034. 
    The user can request a subset of
    the amplitudes appearing in the full statevector. The user provides as input
    the base values, as an array of hexa or integers. This instruction outputs
    the corresponding array of amplitudes, in the same order as the given base values.
    This snapshot is supported in simulation methods: `statevector` and `matrix_product_state`.
