    Add the CMake flag ``USE_CONAN`` (default=``ON``). When installing from source,
    setting this to ``OFF`` allows bypassing the Conan package manager to find libraries
    that are already installed on your system. This is also available as an environment
    variable ``USE_CONAN``, which takes precedence over the CMake flag.
