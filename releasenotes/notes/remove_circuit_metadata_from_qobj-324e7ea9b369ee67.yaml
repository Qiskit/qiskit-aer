    Reduce metadata of circuits in Qobj before simulation and set the metadata
    to ```header``` of ```ExperimentResult``` in python. 
    Previously, metadata is serialized with JSON format and copied to
    the result even though metadata is not used in simulation. If metadata
    can not be serizalized, simulation was failed. This fix works around
    this issue.
