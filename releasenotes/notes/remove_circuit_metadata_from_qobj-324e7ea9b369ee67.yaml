    Fixed a potential issue with running simulations on circuits that have the
    :attr:`.QuantumCircuit.metadata` attribute set. The :attr:`~.QuantumCircuit.metadata`
    attribute can be any python dictionary and previously qiskit-aer would attempt to
    JSON serialize the contents of the attribute to process it with the rest of the rest
    of the circuit input, even if the contents were not JSON serializable. This no longer
    occurs as the :attr:`.QuantumCircuit.metadata`  attribute is not used to run the
    simulation so now the contents are no serialized and instead are directly attached
    to the :class:`qiskit.result.Result` object without attempting to JSON serialize
    the contents.
    Fixed `#1435 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-aer/issues/1435>`__
