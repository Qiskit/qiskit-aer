    Remove "extended_stabilizer" from the automatically selected simulation
    methods. This is needed as the extended stabilizer method is not exact
    and may give incorrect results for certain circuits unless the user
    knows how to optimize its configuration parameters.
    
    The automatic method now only selects from "stabilizer", "density_matrix",
    and "statevector" methods. If a non-Clifford circuit that is too large for
    the statevector method is executed an exception will be raised suggesting
    you could try explicitly using the "extended_stabilizer" or
    "matrix_product_state" methods instead.
