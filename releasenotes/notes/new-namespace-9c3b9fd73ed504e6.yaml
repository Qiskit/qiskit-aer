    The ``qiskit-aer`` Python package has moved to be a self-contained
    namespace, ``qiskit_aer``. Previously, it shared
    a namespace with ``qiskit-terra`` by being ``qiskit.providers.aer``.
    `This was problematic for several reasons <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit/issues/559>`__,
    and this release moves away from it. For the time being ``import qiskit.providers.aer``
    will continue to work and redirect to ``qiskit_aer`` automatically. Imports from the legacy
    ``qiskit.provider.aer`` namespace will emit a ``DeprecationWarning`` in the
    future. To avoid any potential issues starting with this release,
    updating all imports from ``qiskit.providers.aer`` to ``qiskit_aer`` and
    from ``qiskit.Aer`` to ``qiskit_aer.Aer`` is recommended.
