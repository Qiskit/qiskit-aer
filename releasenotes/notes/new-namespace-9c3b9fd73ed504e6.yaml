    The ``qiskit-aer`` Python package has moved to be a self contained
    namespace, ``qiskit_aer``. Previously, the ``qiskit-aer`` package shared
    a namespace with ``qiskit-terra``, ``qiskit.providers.aer``, however this
    was problematic for several reasons (refer to
    https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit/issues/559 for more details) and this
    release moved away from it. For the time being the ``qiskit.providers.aer``
    import will continue to work and imports and usage of it will be redirected
    to ``qiskit_aer`` automatically. The imports from the legacy
    ``qiskit.provider.aer`` namespace will emit a ``DeprecationWarning`` in the
    future. To avoid any potential issues starting with this release
    updating all imports from ``qiskit.providers.aer`` to ``qiskit_aer`` and
    from ``qiskit.Aer`` to ``qiskit_aer.Aer`` is recommended.
