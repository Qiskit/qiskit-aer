upgrade:
  - |
    A deprecated method :meth:`add_nonlocal_quantum_error` in `~.NoiseModel` has been removed.
    No alternative method is available. So if you want to add non-local quantum errors,
    you should write a transpiler pass that inserts your own quantum error into a circuit,
    and run the pass just before running the circuit on Aer simulator.
  - |
    The :meth:`~.NoiseModel.from_backend` now has changed not to accept ``BackendProperties``
    object as a ``backend`` argument. Use newly added :meth:`~.NoiseModel.from_backend_properties`
    method instead.
  - |
    A deprecated ``standard_gates`` argument broadly used in several methods and functions
    across :mod:`~.noise` module has been removed.
  - |
    The constructor of :class:`QuantumError` has now dropped deprecated arguments,
    ``number_of_qubits``, ``standard_gates`` and ``atol``, and the support of deprecated
    json-like objects for ``noise_ops`` argument.
  - |
    The deprecated :mod:`utils.noise_remapper` and :mod:`noise.errors.errorutils` modules
    have been entirely removed.
  - |
    All deprecated functions and classes
    in :mod:`utils.noise_transformation` module has been removed.
deprecations:
  - |
    A ``warnings`` argument broadly used in several methods and functions
    across :mod:`~.noise` module has been deprecated in favor of
    the use of filtering functions in Python's standard ``warnings`` library.
