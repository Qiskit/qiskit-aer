upgrade:
  - |
    Qiskit Aer is no longer compiled with unsafe floating-point optimisations.
    While most of the effects should have been localised to Qiskit Aer, some
    aspects of subnormal handling may previously have been leaked into user code
    by the library incorrectly setting the "flush to zero" mode.  This will not
    happen any more.
fixes:
  - |
    Qiskit Aer will no longer set the floating-point mode to "flush to zero"
    when loaded.  Downstream users may previously have seen warnings from Numpy
    such as:

      The value of the smallest subnormal for <class 'numpy.float64'> type is zero.

    These will now no longer be emitted, and the floating-point handling will be
    correct.
