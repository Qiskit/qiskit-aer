    Implementing general tensor network simulator for GPU accelerated by
    NVIDIA's cuTensoNet APIs of cuQuantum SDK. Any quantum circuits can
    be translated into tensor network and can be simulated.
    To use this simulation method, set method=tensor_network and device=GPU
    This method supports both statevector and density matrix simulations,
    noise simulation can be done by single shot with density matrix
    if there is no save_statevector operation.
    This method supports parallelization by multiple GPUs and MPI processes
    by using tensor network slicing technique.
    (Note : It will take very long time if the circuits is complicated.)
