deprecations:
  - |
    Remove the parts of the code that relied on deprecated `qiskit` components that are being removed in Qiskit 2.0::
      * Everything that uses `convert_to_target` is removed
      * Usage of `qiskit.pulse` is removed.
      * `BackendProperties` is not being imported from `qiskit.providers.models.backendproperties` anymore.
      * `BackendV1` related code is removed.
      * Use of `BackendStatus` was removed, resulting in the removal of the `status` method for the Aer backend.
