  - |
    Remove the parts of the code that relied on deprecated `qiskit` components:
      * Everything that uses `convert_to_target` is removed
      * Usage of `qiskit.pulse` is removed.
      * Use of `BackendProperties` is removed, resulting in the removal of :class:`.NoiseModel`'s :meth:`.from_backend_properties` method.
      * `BackendV1` related code is removed.
      * Use of `BackendStatus` was removed, resulting in the removal of the :meth:`status` method for the Aer backend.
