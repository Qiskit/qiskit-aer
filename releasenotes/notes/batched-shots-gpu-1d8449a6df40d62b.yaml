    Adds a batched shot simulation optimization for GPU simulations. This
    optional will use available memory on 1 or more GPUs to run multiple
    simulation shots in parallel for greatly improved performance on
    multi-shot simulations with noise models and/or intermediate measurements.

    This option is enabled by default when using ``device="GPU"`` for the
    :class:`~qiskit.providers.aer.AerSimulator` for ``"statevector"`` and
    ``"density_matrix"`` simulation methods and can be disabled by setting the
    ``batched_shots_gpu=False`` in the simulator options.

    This optimization is most benefical for small to medium numbers of qubits
    where there is sufficient GPU memory to run multiple simulations in
    parallel. The maximum number of activate circuit qubits for enabling this
    optimization can be configued using the ``batch_shots_gpu_max_qubits``
    simulator option. The default value of this option is 16.
