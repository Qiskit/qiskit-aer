    If the environment variable `MPS_OUTPUT_DATA` is set to 1, then MPS
    log data is printed to the metadata. This includes, after every relevant
    instruction, the bond dimensions and the discarded value i.e.,
    the sum of the squares of the Schmidt coeffients 
    that were discarded by approximation.
