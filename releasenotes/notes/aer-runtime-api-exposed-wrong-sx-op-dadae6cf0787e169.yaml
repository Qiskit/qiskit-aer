    Aer runtime api (from contrib) exposed the wrong sx operation,
    implemented with a rx. The implementation is changed now to
    apply the AER::Linalg::Matrix::SX unitary. This way the api
    has the same behavior as the documentation states and also
    how the sx gate behaves in python.
    Fix for: https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-aer/issues/1925
