    Added `psutil <https://pypi.org/project/psutil/>`__ as a dependency for
    Qiskit Aer. This is used to determine the amount of physical resources
    available. ``psutil`` is currently a dependency of Qiskit, which is a
    requirement for Qiskit Aer, so ``psutil`` was effectively already required
    for any ``qiskit-aer`` installation. But, as qiskit-aer is now using it
    directly is now a direct dependency for ``qiskit-aer``.
