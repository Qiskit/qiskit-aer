    Replace Qiskit SVD function with OpenBLAS/LAPACK SVD functions ``zgesvd``
    and ``zgesdd``. By default ``zgesvd`` is used. Performance of ``zgesdd`` is better than
    that of ``zgesvd`` on large matrices, whereas ``zgesvd`` performs better on small matrices.
    User can use ``zgesdd`` function
    setting the environment variable ``QISKIT_LAPACK_SVD=DC``.
