    Fixes a bug ([#1153](https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-aer/issues/1153))
    where noise on conditional gates was always being applied regardless of
    whether the conditional gate was actually applied based on the classical
    register value. Now noise on a conditional gate will only be applied in
    the case where the conditional gate is applied.
