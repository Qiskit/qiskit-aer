    This fix changes `device` query method from running simple circuit to
    search devices from C++ binary to prevent initializing GPUs at
    initialization phase and simulation methods are listed in Python code.
    Aer built with GPU support will not initialize when `device=CPU` is used.
    And only initialize and access GPUs defined in `target_gpus` option.
