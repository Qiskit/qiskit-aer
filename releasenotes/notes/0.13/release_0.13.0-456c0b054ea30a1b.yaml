    Here are highlights of the Aer 0.13.0 release:

    Aer's backend is now backendV2.

    Introducing shot-branching optimization that accelerates dynamic circuits
    simulations. By using `shot_branching_enable=True`, multi-shots
    simulation starts with single state and state will be branched with
    attached shots dynamically. This option is available for `statevector`,
    `density_matrix` and `tensor_network` methods.

    Adding support for classical expressions used for branch operations.

    Introducing runtime parameter binding that accelerates parameterized
    circuits simulations on GPU. With `runtime_parameter_bind_enable=True`
    and `batched_shots_gpu=True`, this optimization will be enabled on GPU.
    This optimization can be used with Aer primitives.

    Fix dynamic link library path for GPU binary distributions.

    Now Aer supports AMD's GPUs based on ROCm (building from source code only)
