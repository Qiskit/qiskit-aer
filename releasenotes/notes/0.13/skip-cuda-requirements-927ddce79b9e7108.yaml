    Build environment variable was added to enable building Qiskit-Aer without the CUDA 
    requirements. The new variable is ``QISKIT_ADD_CUDA_REQUIREMENTS`` and can be set to 
    False/No/Off or True/Yes/On. By default, it is assumed True.

    A new environment variable ``QISKIT_ADD_CUDA_REQUIREMENTS`` can be sed to control 
    whether or not build the Python package for Qiskit-Aer with CUDA requirements. This 
    flag can be set to False/No/Off or True/Yes/On. By default it is assumed True. This 
    is useful in case a CUDA instalation is already available on the system where 
    Qiskit-Aer will run. Not including the requirements results in a smaller footprint 
    and facilitates leveraging different CUDA installs for development purposes. 
    The new flag can used like::
    
        cd <Qiskit-Aer source folder>
        
        QISKIT_AER_PACKAGE_NAME='qiskit-aer-gpu' \
        QISKIT_AER_CUDA_MAJOR=$CUDA_MAJOR \
        QISKIT_ADD_CUDA_REQUIREMENTS=False \
           python3 setup.py bdist_wheel -- \
              -DAER_THRUST_BACKEND=CUDA ...
