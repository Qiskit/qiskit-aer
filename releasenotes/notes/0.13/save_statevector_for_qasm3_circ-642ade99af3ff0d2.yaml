    :meth:``QuantumCircuit.save_statevector()`` does not work if the circuit
    is generated from OpenQASM3 text because its quantum registers have duplicated
    qubit instances. With this commit, :meth:``QuantumCircuit.save_statevector()``
    uses :data:``QuantumCircuit.qubits`` to get qubits to be saved.
