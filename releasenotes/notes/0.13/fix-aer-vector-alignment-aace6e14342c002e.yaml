    Change ``AER::Vector`` object alignement to 64-byte. In some cases, it is used to 
    initialize ``AER:QV::QubitVector`` objects by moving storage ownership to these 
    objects. As the code assumes that ``AER:QV::QubitVector`` storage is at least 
    32-byte aligned for AVX2 load instructions, this change enforces the same alignement 
    requirements for both  ``AER::Vector`` and  ``AER:QV::QubitVector`` objects so that 
    one doesn't get into segmentation faults.
