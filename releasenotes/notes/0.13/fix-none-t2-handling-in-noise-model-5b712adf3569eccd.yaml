    Fixed a bug where :meth:`~.NoiseModel.from_backend` raises an error when
    a backend reports no T2 value (while it reports T1 value) for a qubit,
    which was an oversight in the previous fix on None handling:
    `#1818 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-aer/issues/1818>`__.
    Fixed `#1896 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-aer/issues/1896>`__.
