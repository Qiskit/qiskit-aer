    Aer runtime api (from contrib) exposed the wrong sx operation,
    implemented with a rx. The implementation is changed now by
    adding AerState::apply_mcsx and calling it from aer_apply_sx.
    This way the api has the same behavior as the documentation 
    states and also how the sx gate behaves in python.
    Fix for: https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-aer/issues/1925
