upgrade:

    :meth:`.SamplerV2.run` returns ``SamplerPubResult``, which was introduced in Qiskit 1.1.
    More precisely, the return type is ``PrimitiveJob[PrimitiveResult[SamplerPubResult]]``.
    Previously, it used to be PrimitiveJob[PrimitiveResult[PubResult]].
  - |
    :class:`.SamplerV2` won't accept ``np.random.Generator`` as ``seed``
    because :meth:`.AerSimulator.run` does not support it.
  - |
    Qiskit Aer requires Qiskit 1.1.0 or later.
