fixes:
  - |
    - Clone configuration and properties from Qiskit to Aer #2197 
    - Deprecation of V1 backends passed to `AerSimulator.from_backend()`
      will be removed in Qiskit 2.0
    - target.qubit_properties is now rust function, so list can not be
      updated by [] operator directly
    - remove QobjExperimentHeader in AerCompiler this is from #2187 
    - remove using qobj in AerBackend.run this will be removed by #2187
    - replace some V1 based fake backends to GenericBackendV2 
    - Remove transpile for test using `UnitaryGate` or `DiagonalGate`
