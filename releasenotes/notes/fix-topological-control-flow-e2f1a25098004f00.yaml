    Fixed incorrect logic in the control-flow compiler that could allow unrelated instructions to
    appear "inside" control-flow bodies during execution, causing incorrect results.  For example,
    previously::

        from qiskit import QuantumCircuit
        from qiskit_aer import AerSimulator

        backend = AerSimulator(method="statevector")

        circuit = QuantumCircuit(3, 3)
        circuit.measure(0, 0)
        circuit.measure(1, 1)

        with circuit.if_test((0, True)):
            with circuit.if_test((1, False)):
                circuit.x(2)

        with circuit.if_test((0, False)):
            with circuit.if_test((1, True)):
                circuit.x(2)

        circuit.measure(range(3), range(3))
        print(backend.run(circuit, method=method, shots=100).result())

    would print ``{'010': 100}`` as the nested control-flow operations would accidentally jump over
    the first X gate on qubit 2, which should have been executed.
