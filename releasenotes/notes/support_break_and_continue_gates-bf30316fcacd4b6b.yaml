    The :class:`.AerSimulator` backend with methods:
    
    * ``statevector``
    * ``density_matrix``
    * ``matrix_product_state``
    * ``stabilizer``
    
    now report that they support ``break_loop`` and ``continue_loop`` instructions when used
    as backends for the Terra :func:`~qiskit.compiler.transpile` function.  The simulators
    already did support these, but had just not been reporting it.
