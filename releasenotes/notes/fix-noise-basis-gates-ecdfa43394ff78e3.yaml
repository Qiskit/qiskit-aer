    Fixes bug in
    :meth:`~qiskit.providers.aer.noise.NoiseModel.from_backend` and
    :meth:`~qiskit.providers.aer.QasmSimulator.from_backend` where
    :attr:`~qiskit.providers.aer.noise.NoiseModel.basis_gates` was set
    incorrectly for IBMQ devices with basis gate set
    ``['id', 'rz', 'sx', 'x', 'cx']``. Now the noise model will always
    have the same basis gates as the backend basis gates regardless of
    whether those instructions have errors in the noise model or not.
