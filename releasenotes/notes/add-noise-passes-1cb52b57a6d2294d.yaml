features:
  - |
    Add two transpiler passes for inserting instruction-dependent noises:
    :class:`~qiskit.providers.aer.noise.passes.LocalNoisePass` and
    :class:`~qiskit.providers.aer.noise.passes.RelaxationNoisePass`.
    The former inserts noises to the specified place in a circuit.
    The latter inserts thermal relaxation noises depending on the durations
    of instructions to which the noises are added.
upgrade:
  - |
    Upgrade :meth:`NoiseModel.from_backend` so that it adds relaxation noises
    to delays by default. As a result, the default noise model requires scheduled
    circuits to which noises are added. This is expected to improve the behavior
    of default noisy simulators against circuits with delays such as T1 experiments.
    Previously, simulation with default noise model produces the same
    :math:`|1\rangle` probabilities unexpectedly because it adds noises
    only on X gates and measurements and does not add any noises on the delays.
    After this PR, the default noisy simulator will expectedly produce different
    :math:`|1\rangle` probabilities depending the duration of delays.
deprecations:
  - |
    Deprecate acceting `BackendProperties` for `backend` option in
    :meth:`NoiseModel.from_backend` in favor of accepting `Backend` only.
