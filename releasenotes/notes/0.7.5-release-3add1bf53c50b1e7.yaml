    This release is a bugfix release that fixes compatibility in the precompiled
    binary wheel packages with numpy versions < 1.20.0. The previous release
    0.7.4 was building the binaries in a way that would require numpy 1.20.0
    which has been resolved now, so the precompiled binary wheel packages
    will work with any numpy compatible version.
