    A runtime parameter binding option is implemented to bind paramters at
    runtime to a single circuit instead running multiple circuits as input.
    An option ``runtime_parameter_bind_enable=True`` enables this feature and
    for GPU, ``batched_shots_gpu=True`` should be also set to speed up
    simulating parameterized circuit.
