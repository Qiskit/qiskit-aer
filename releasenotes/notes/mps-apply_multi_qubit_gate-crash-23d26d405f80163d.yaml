    MPS::apply_multi_qubit_gate could crash in some circumstances
fixes:
  - |
    A matrix was attempted to be constructed despite having `is_diagonal`
    parameter set to true and the passed matrix being a vector. The attempt
    to access the element incorrectly resulted in a crash. Now a vector is
    constructed when `is_diagonal` is true. For more information refer to
    `#2292 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-aer/issues/2292>`
