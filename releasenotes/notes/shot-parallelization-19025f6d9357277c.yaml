    Adds the new option ``max_shot_size`` option to a cutom executor for
    run multiple shots execution of a noisy circuit in parallel. 

    For example configuring ``max_shot_size`` with a custom executor 

    .. code-block:: python

       backend = AerSimulator(max_shot_size = 1, max_job_size=1, executor=custom_executor)
       job = backend.run(circuits)

    will split the shots of a noisy circuit into multiple circuits.
    After all individual shot's execution finish running the job results 
    are automatically combined into a single Result object that is 
    returned by ``job.result()``.
