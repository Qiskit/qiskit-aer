    DiagonalFusion::aggregate_operations could crash in some circumstances

  - |
    Sometimes `DiagonalFuson::get_next_deagonal_end` had an invalid `from`
    parameter. Now it has a check to return -1 in such a case. For more
    details refer to: `#2291 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-aer/issues/2291>`
