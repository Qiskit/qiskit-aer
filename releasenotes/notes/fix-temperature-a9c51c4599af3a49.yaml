    Fixed a bug in computation of the excited population from qubit frequency and temperature
    in noise model construction. Previously, there was an incorrect exponential factor of 2
    and hence the excited population was incorrect. This fix affects users
    who generate a noise model using :meth:`NoiseModel.from_backend` with non-zero
    ``temperature`` while it does not affect users of the default noise model (temperature=0).
