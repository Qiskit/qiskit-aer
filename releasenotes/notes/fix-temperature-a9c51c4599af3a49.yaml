    Fixed a bug in computation of the excited population from qubit frequency and temperature
    in noise model construction. Previously, there was an incorrect exponential factor of 2
    and hence the excited population was incorrectly squared. This fix will affects users
    who generate a noise model using :meth:`NoiseModel.from_backend` with ``temperature``
    option while it won't affect users of the default noise model that assumes no excitation.
