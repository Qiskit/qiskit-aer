    Fixed a bug in :meth:`NoiseModel.from_backend` where using the ``temperature`` kwarg with
    a non-default value would incorrectly compute the excited state population for
    the specified temperature. Previously, there was an additional factor of 2 in
    the Boltzman distribution calculation leading to an incorrect smaller value
    for the excited state population.
