    Performance improvement in algorithm for apply_measure in MPS: this 
    generalizes the improvement done for all qubits to any subset of the qubits.
    Also removed the heuristic for choosing the algorithm for sample_measure.
    The default is now `mps_apply_measure` and the user can specify 
    'mps_probabilities` if she prefers that algorithm.
