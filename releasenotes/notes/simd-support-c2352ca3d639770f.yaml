    Extends the SIMD vectorization of the statevector simulation method to the
    unitary matrix, superoperator matrix, and density matrix simulation methods.
    This gives roughtly a 2x performance increase general simulation using the
    :class:`~qiskit.providers.aer.UnitarySimulator`, the ``"density_matrix"``
    method of the :class:`~qiskit.providers.aer.QasmSimulator`, gate
    fusion, and noise simulation.
