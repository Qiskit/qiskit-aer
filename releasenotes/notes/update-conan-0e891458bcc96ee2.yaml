    The minimum version of `Conan <https://conan.io/>`__ has been increased to 1.31.2. This was necessary
    to fix a compatibility issue with newer versions of the `urllib3 <https://pypi.org/project/urllib3/>`__ (which
    is a dependency of Conan). It also adds native support for AppleClang 12 which is useful for users with
    new Apple computers.
