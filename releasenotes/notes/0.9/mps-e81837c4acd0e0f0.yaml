features:
  - |
    Adds ability to record logging data for the ``matrix_product_state``
    simulation method to the experiment result metadata by setting the
    backend option  ``mps_log_data=True``. The saved data includes the
    bond dimensions and the discarded value (the sum of the squares of
    the Schmidt coeffients that were discarded by approximation) after
    every relevant circuit instruction.
fixes:
  - |
    Fixes bug with applying the ``unitary`` gate in using the ``matrix_product_state``
    simulation method which did not correctly support permutations in the ordering of
    the qubits on which the gate is applied.
  - |
    Fixes an issue where gate fusion could still be enabled for the
    ``matrix_product_state`` simulation method even though it is not supported. 
    Now fusion is always disabled for this method.
  - |
    Fixed bug in the ``matrix_product_state`` simulation method in computing the
    normalization following truncation of the  Schmidt coefficients after
    performing the SVD.
other:
  - |
    Improves the performance of the measurement sampling algorithm for the
    ``matrix_product_state`` simulation method.
    The new default behaviour is to always sample using the
    improved ``mps_apply_measure`` method. The ``mps_probabilities`` sampling
    method be still used by setting the custom option value
    ``mps_sample_measure_algorithm="mps_probabilities"``.
