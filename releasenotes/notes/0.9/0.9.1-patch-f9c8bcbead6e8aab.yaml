upgrade:
  - |
    ``optimize_ideal_threshold`` and ``optimize_noisy_threshold`` have been
    removed from the lists of simulator defaults and the documentation. 
    These have had no effect since Aer 0.5.1, but these references to them
    had remained accidentally.
fixes:
  - |
    Fixes `#1351 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-aer/issue/1351>`__
    where running an empty :obj:`~qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit` with
    a noise model set would cause the simulator to crash.
  - |
    Fixes `#1347 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-aer/issue/1347>`__
    where the behaviour of using the
    :meth:`~qiskit.providers.aer.AerSimulator.set_options` and
    :meth:`~qiskit.providers.aer.AerSimulator.set_option` methods of 
    simulator backends could lead to different behavior for some options.
  - |
    Fixes an bug where using a Dask Client executor would cause an error at
    job submission due to the executor Client not being pickleable.
  - |
    Fixed an issue with the `matrix_product_state` simulation method where
    the accumulation of small rounding errors during measurement of many
    quits could sometimes cause a segmentation fault.
  - |
    Fixes an unintended change between qiskit-aer 0.8.0 and 0.9.0 where when
    running a list of circuits with an invalid circuit using the `automatic`
    simulation method of the :class:`~qiskit.providers.aer.AerSimulator` or
    :class:`~qiskit.providers.aer.QasmSimulator` would raise an exception
    for an invalid input qobj rather than return partial results for the
    circuits that were valid.
  - |
    Fixes an issue with the standalone simulator where it would return a schema
    invalid JSON in the case of partial results where only a subset of
    circuit simulations failed.
  - |
    Fixes `#1346 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-aer/issue/1346>`__
    which was a bug in the handling of the ``parameter_binds`` kwarg of
    the backend :meth:`~qiskit.providers.aer.AerSimulator.run` method that
    would result in an error if the parameterized circuit was transpiled to
    a different set of basis gates than the original parameterizations.
