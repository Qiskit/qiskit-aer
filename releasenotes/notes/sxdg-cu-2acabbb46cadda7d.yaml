    Add qiskit library SXdgGate and CUGate to the supported basis gates for
    the Aer simulator backends. Note that the CUGate gate is only natively
    supported for the statevector and unitary methods. For other simulation
    methods it must be transpiled to the supported basis gates for that method.
