    Fixes a bug in :class:`.RelaxationNoisePass` where instruction durations
    were always assumed to be in *dt* time units, regardless of the actual
    unit of the isntruction. Now unit conversion is correctly handled for
    all instruction duration units.

    See `#1453 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-aer/issues/1453>`__
    for details.
