    Added partial support for running on ppc64le and s390x Linux platforms.
    This release will start publishing pre-compiled binaries for ppc64le and
    s390x Linux platforms on all Python versions. However, unlike other
    supported platforms not all of Qiskit's upstream dependencies support these
    platforms yet. So a C/C++ compiler may be required to build and install
    these dependencies and a simple ``pip install qiskit-aer`` with just a
    working Python environment will not be sufficient to install Qiskit Aer.
    Additionally, these same constraints prevent us from testing the
    pre-compiled wheels before publishing them, so the same guarantees around
    platform support that exist for the other platforms don't apply to these
    platforms.
issues:
  - |
    When running on Linux s390x platforms (or other big endian platforms)
    running circuits that contain :class:`~.UnitaryGate` operations will not
    work because of an endianess bug.
    See `#1506 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-aer/issues/1506>`__ for more
    details.
