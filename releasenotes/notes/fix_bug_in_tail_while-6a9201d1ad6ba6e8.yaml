    Fixes an issue when while_loop is the tail of QuantumCircuit. while_loop
    is translated to jump and mark instructions. However, if a while_loop is
    at the end of a circuit, its mark instruction is truncated wrongly. This
    fix corrects the truncation algorithm to always remain mark instructions.
