    Fixes an issue with :class:`.LocalNoisePass` for noise functions that
    return a :class:`.QuantumCircuit` for the noise op. These were appended
    to the DAG as an opaque circuit instruction that must be unrolled to be
    simulated. This fix composes them so that the cirucit instructions are
    added to the new DAG and can be simulated without additional unrolling
    if all circuit instructions are supported by the simulator.

    See `#1447 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-aer/issues/1447>`__
    for details.
