    Fixed an issue where the :class:`qiskit.extensions.Initialize` instruction
    would disable measurement sampling optimization for the ``statevector`` and
    ``matrix_product_state`` simulation methods of the
    :class:`~qiskit.providers.aer.AerSimulator` and
    :class:`~qiskit.providers.aer.QasmSimulator` simulators, even when it was
    the first circuit instruction or applied to all qubits and hence
    deterministic.
    Fixed `#1210 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-aer/issues/1210>`__
