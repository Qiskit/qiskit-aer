    A function ``aer_state_initialize()`` in C API wrongly takes no argument though
    it initializes a state created by ``aer_state()``. Example codes pass ``handler``
    and rouboustness of C compiler allows its compilation. This commit corrects for
    ``aer_state_initialize()`` to take an argument ``handler`` to be initialized.
