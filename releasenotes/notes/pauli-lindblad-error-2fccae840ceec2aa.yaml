    Adds a new :class:`.PauliLindbladError` quantum error subclass.
    This class represents a Pauli error quantum channel generated by 
    Pauli-Lindblad dissipator terms. This allows for more efficient
    representation and error sampling for large qubit Pauli channels
    generated by sparse Pauli-lindblad terms.
