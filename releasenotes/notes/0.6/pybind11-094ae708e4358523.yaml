features:
  - |
    Improve performance of simulator result classes by using move semantics
    and removing unnecessary copies that were happening when combining results
    from separate experiments into the final result object.
  - |
    Greatly improve performance of pybind11 conversion of simulator results by
    using move semantics where possible, and by moving vector and matrix results
    to Numpy arrays without copies.
