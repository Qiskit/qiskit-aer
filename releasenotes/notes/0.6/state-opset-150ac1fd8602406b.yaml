upgrade:
  - |
    Adds an OpSet object to the base simulator State class to allow easier
    validation of instructions, gates, and snapshots supported by simulators.
  - |
    Refactor OpSet class. Moved OpSet to separate header file and add
    ``contains`` and ``diference`` methods based on ``std::set::contains``
    and ``std::algorithm::set_difference``. These replace the removed invalid
    and validate instructions from OpSet, but with the order reversed. It
    returns a list of other ops not in current opset rather than opset
    instructions not in the other.
