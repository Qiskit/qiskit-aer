    This 0.6.0 release includes numerous performance improvements for all
    simulators in the Aer provider and significant changes to the build system
    when building from source. The main changes are support for SIMD
    vectorization, approximation in the matrix product state method via
    bond-dimension truncation, more efficient Pauli expectation value
    computation, and greatly improved efficiency in Python wrapping of
    C++ result objects. The build system was upgraded to use the Conan C++
    package manager to manage common dependencies when building from source.
upgrade:
  - |
    Change build system to use the Conan package manager. This tool will handle
    most of the dependencies needed by the C++ source code. Internet connection
    may be needed for the first build or when dependencies are added/updated,
    in order to download the required packages if they are not in your Conan
    local repository.
    
    When building the standalone version of qiskit-aer you must install conan
    first with:
    ```
    pip install conan
    ```
