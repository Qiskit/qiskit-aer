    This 0.6.0 release includes numerous performance improvements for all
    simulators in the Aer provider and significant changes to the build system
    when building from source. The main changes are support for SIMD
    vectorization, approximation in the matrix product state method via
    bond-dimension truncation, more efficient Pauli expectation value
    computation, and greatly improved efficiency in Python conversion of
    C++ result objects. The build system was upgraded to use the
    `Conan <https://conan.io/>`__ to manage common C++ dependencies when
    building from source.

    Changes the build system to use the `Conan package manager <https://conan.io/>`__.
    This tool will handle most of the dependencies needed by the C++ source code.
    Internet connection may be needed for the first build or when dependencies
    are added or updated, in order to download the required packages if they are
    not in your Conan local repository.
    
    When building the standalone version of qiskit-aer you must install conan
    first with:
    ```
    pip install conan
    ```
