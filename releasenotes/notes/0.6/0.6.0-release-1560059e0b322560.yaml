    This 0.6.0 release includes numerous performance improvements for all
    simulators in the Aer provider. The main changes are support for SIMD
    vectorization, approximation in the matrix product state method via
    bond-dimension truncation, more efficient Pauli expectation value
    computation and improved efficiency in Python wrapping of C++ result
    objects.
