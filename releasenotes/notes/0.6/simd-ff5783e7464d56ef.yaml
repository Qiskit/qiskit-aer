    Improves the performance of the `"statevector"` simulation method of the
    :class:`qiskit.providers.aer.QasmSimulator` and 
    :class:`qiskit.providers.aer.StatevectorSimulator` by using SIMD
    intrinsics on systems that support the AVX2 instruction set. AVX2
    support is automatically detected and enabled at runtime.
