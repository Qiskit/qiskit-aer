    Previously :class:`~.AerSimulator` modifies circuit metadata to maintain
    consistency between input and output of simulation with side effect of
    unexpected view of metadata from applicatiln in simiulation. This fix
    avoids using circuit metadata to maintain consistency internaly and then
    always provides consistent view of metadata to application.
