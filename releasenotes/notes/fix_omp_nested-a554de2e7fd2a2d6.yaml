    OpenMP parallel nested was not correctly set when number of input circuits
    is less than number of threads.
    Also parallel state update was not correctly set if number of input circuits
    is more than 1.
    This release fixes these settings to get more speed up with OpenMP.
    For single circuit with multiple-shots run, when nested parallel is used
    `omp_nested=True` is set in the metadata of result for a circuit.
