    Fixed an issue with use of the ``matrix_product_state`` method of the
    :class:`~qiskit.providers.aer.AerSimulator` and
    :class:`~qiskit.providers.aer.QasmSimulator` simulators when running a
    noisy simulation with Kraus errors. Previously, the matrix product state
    simulation method would not propogate changes to neighboring qubits after
    applying the Kraus matrix. This has been fixed so the output from the
    simulation is correct.
    Fixed `#1184 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-aer/issues/1184>`__ and
    `#1205 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-aer/issues/1205>`__
