    Fixed support in the :meth:`.AerSimulator.from_backend` method for instantiating
    an :class:`~.AerSimulator` instance from an a :class:`~.BackendV2` object.
    Previously, attempting to use :meth:`.AerSimulator.from_backend` with a
    :class:`~.BackendV2` object would have raised an :class:`~.AerError` saying this
    wasn't supported.
