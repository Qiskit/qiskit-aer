    Fix two bugs in AerStatevector. AerStatevector uses mc* instructions, which are
    not enabled in matrix_product_state method. This commit changes AerStatevector
    not to use MC* and use H, X, Y, Z, U and CX. AerStatevector also failed if an
    instruction is decomposed to empty QuantumCircuit. This commit allows such
    instruction.
