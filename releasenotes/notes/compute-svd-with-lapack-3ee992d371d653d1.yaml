    Replace Qiskit SVD function with OpenBLAS/LAPACK SVD functions ``zgesvd``
    and ``zgesdd``. By default ``zgesvd`` is used, but performace decrease with
    big matrices. On the other hand, ``zgesdd`` has bad performance with small
    matrices, and better with big matrices. User can use ``zgesdd`` function
    setting the environment variable ``QISKIT_LAPACK_SVD=DC``.

    Performance may decrease depending on the SVD method used.
