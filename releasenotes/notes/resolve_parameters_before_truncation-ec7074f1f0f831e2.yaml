    Fixes a bug with truncation of circuits in parameterized Qobjs. 
    Previously parameters of parameterized QObj could be wrongly resolved
    if unused qubits of their circuits were truncated, because indices of
    the parameters were not updated after the instructions on unmeasured qubits
    were removed.

    See `#1427 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-aer/issues/1427>`__
    for details.
