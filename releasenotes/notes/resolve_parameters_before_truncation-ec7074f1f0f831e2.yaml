    Fixes a bug to truncate qubits of circuits in parameterized QObj. 
    Previously parameters of parameterized QObj can be wrongly resolved
    if unused qubits of their circuits are truncated because indices of
    the parameters are not maintained even though instructions for the
    unused qubits are reduced.

    See `Issue 1427 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-aer/issues/1427>`__
    for details.
