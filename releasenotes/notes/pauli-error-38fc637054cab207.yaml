    Adds a new :class:`.PauliError` quantum error subclass. This class is
    interchangable with :class:`.QuantumError` objects that only contained
    Pauli error terms for use with noise models and simulations, however it
    has a more efficient implemention based on the ``quantum_info.PauliList``
    operator for use in constructing larger number of qubit errors via
    composing, tensor producting etc.
