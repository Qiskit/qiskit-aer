    Aer's ``setup.py`` has been updated to no longer attempt to make calls to ``pip`` to
    install build requirements, both manually and via the ``setup_requires`` option in
    ``setuptools.setup``.  The preferred way to build Aer is to use a `PEP 517 <https://peps.python.org/pep-0517/>`__-compatible
    builder such as:

    .. code-block:: text

      pip install .

    This change means that a direct call to ``setup.py`` will no longer work if the
    build requirements are not installed.  This is inline with modern Python packaging
    guidelines.
