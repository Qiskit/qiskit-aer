    The previously deprecated ``qobj`` argument name of the
    :class:`~.AerSimulator` and :class:`~.PulseSimulator` classes'
    :meth:`~.AerSimulator.run` method has now been removed. This argument
    name was deprecated as part of the Qiskit Aer 0.8.0 release and has
    been by the ``circuits`` and ``schedules`` argument name respectively.
