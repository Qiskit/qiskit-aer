    The ``BLA_VENDOR`` environment variable can now be specified to use a
    different BLAS library when building Qiskit Aer from source. By default
    if this is not specified OpenBLAS will be used by default. If
    the BLAS library specified in `BLA_VENDOR`` can not be found then the
    Cmake build process will stop.
