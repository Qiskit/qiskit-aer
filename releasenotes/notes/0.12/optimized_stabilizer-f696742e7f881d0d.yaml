    The performance of the ``stabilizer`` simulation method (i.e. when setting 
    the keyword argument ``method="stabilizer"`` when initializing an
    :class:`~.AerSimulator` instance) has been improved. This
    was accomplished by changing the internal data order to align data access
    for improved CPU cache locality and improving the efficiency of integer
    bit operations.
