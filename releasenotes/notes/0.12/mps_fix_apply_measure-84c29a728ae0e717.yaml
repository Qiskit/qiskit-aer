    Fixed an issue in the matrix product state simulation method (i.e.
    setting the keyword argument ``method="matrix_product_state"`` when
    initializing an :class:`~.AerSimulator` object) where the simulator
    would incorrectly sort the qubits prior to performing measurment
    potentially resulting in an infinite loop. This has been fixed so
    the measurement of the qubits occurs in the order of the current MPS
    structure and then sorting afterwards as a post-processing step. This also
    will likely improve the performance of the simulation method and enable
    more accurate representation of entangled states.
    Fixed `#1694 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-aer/issues/1694>`__
