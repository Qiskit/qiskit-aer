    The :class:`~.PulseSimulator` backend has been deprecated and will be
    removed in a future release. If you're using the :class:`~.PulseSimulator`
    backend to perform pulse level simulation, instead you should use the
    `Qiskit Dynamics <https://qiskit-extensions.github.io/qiskit-dynamics>`__ library
    instead to perform the simulation. Qiskit Dynamics provides a more
    flexible and robust pulse level simulation framework than the
    :class:`~.PulseSimulator` backend.
