    Added a new class method :meth:`~.NoiseModel.from_backend_properties` to
    the :class:`NoiseModel`. This enables constructing a new :class:`~.NoiseModel`
    from a :class:`~.BackendProperties` object. Similar functionality used
    to be present in the :meth:`.NoiseModel.from_backend` constructor,
    however it was removed since a :class:`~.BackendProperties` object alone
    doesn't contain sufficient information create a :class:`~.NoiseModel`
    object.
