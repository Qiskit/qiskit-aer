    This is optimization for multi-shots simulations with intermediate measure
    , conditional branches or noise simulations.
    Simulation starts from 1 state and state will be branched when operation
    has randomness (measure, reset, initialize, Kraus, noises)
    With this option, simulator can decrease memory space and simulation time.
    To enable this optimization set shot_branching_enable backend option.
    (Default: True)
