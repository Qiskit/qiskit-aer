deprecations:
  - |
    Adding non-local quantum errors to a
    :class:`~qiskit.providers.aer.noise.NoiseModel` has been deprecated due to
    inconsistencies in how this noise is applied to the optimized circuit.
    Non-local noise should be manually added to a scheduled circuit in Qiskit
    using a custom transpiler pass before being run on the simulator.
