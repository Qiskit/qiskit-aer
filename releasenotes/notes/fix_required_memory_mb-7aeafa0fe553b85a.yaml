    requried_memory_mb function for statevector returns wrong value when number
    of qubits is very large because of overflow of 64 bits integer.
    Now it returns SIZE_MAX value when number of qubits is too large so that
    Qiskit Aer can know memory is not sufficient for
    statvector/unitary/density matrix methods.
