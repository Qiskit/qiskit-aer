    Deprecates :meth:`AerBackend.status` and :meth:`NoiseMode.from_backend_properties` methods.
    This follows the removal of `BackendV1` from `qiskit` and with it, corresponding classes
    such as `BackendProperties` and `BackendStatus`.

    The property-handling methods of :class:`NoiseMode` remain, as :meth:`NoiseModel.from_backend`
    relies of them when constructing a noise model from `IBMBackend` obtained from `qiskit-ibm-runtime`.
