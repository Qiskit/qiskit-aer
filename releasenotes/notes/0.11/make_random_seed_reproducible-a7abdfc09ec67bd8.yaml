    Because a seed was randomly assigned to each circuit if seed_simulator is not set,
    multi-circuit simulation was not reproducible with another multi-circuit simulation.
    Users needed to run multiple single-circuit simulation with the seed_simulator which
    is randomly assigned in the multi-circuit simulation. This fix allows users to reproduce
    multi-circuit simulation with another multi-circuit simulation by setting seed_simulator
    of the first circuit in the first multi-circuit simulation. This fix also resolve an
    issue reported in https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-aer/issues/1511, where simulation
    with parameter-binds returns identical results for each circuit instance.
