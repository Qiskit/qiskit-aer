    Fix performance regression in noisy simulations due to large increase in
    serialization overhead for loading noise models from Python into C++
    resulting from unintended nested Python multiprocessing calls.
    See `issue 1407 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-aer/issues/1407>`__
    for details.
