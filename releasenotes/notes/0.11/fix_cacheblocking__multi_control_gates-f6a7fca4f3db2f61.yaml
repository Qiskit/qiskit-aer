    This is fix for cache blocking transpiler and chunk parallelization for
    GPUs or MPI. This fix fixes issue with qubits which has many control or
    target qubits (> blocking_qubits). From this fix, only target qubits of
    the multi-controlled gate is cache blocked in blocking_qubits.
    But it does not support case if number of target qubits is still larger
    than blocking_qubits (i.e. large unitary matrix multiplication)
