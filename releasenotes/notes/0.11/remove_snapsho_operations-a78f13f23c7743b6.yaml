upgrade:
  - |
    Removed snapshot instructions (such as ``SnapshotStatevector``) which were deprecated since 0.9.0.
    Applications that use these instructions need to be modified to use corresponding save
    instructions (such as :class:`.SaveStatevector`).
  - |
    Removed the ``qiskit_aer.extensions`` module completely.  With the removal of
    the snapshot instructions, this module has become empty and no longer serves
    a purpose.
