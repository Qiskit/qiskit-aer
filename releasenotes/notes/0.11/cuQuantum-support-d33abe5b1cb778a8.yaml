    Added support for cuQuantum, NVIDIA's APIs for quantum computing,
    to accelerate statevector, density matrix and unitary simulators
    by using GPUs.
    This is experiemental implementation for cuQuantum Beta 2. (0.1.0)
    cuStateVec APIs are enabled to accelerate instead of Aer's implementations
    by building Aer by setting path of cuQuantum to ``CUSTATEVEC_ROOT``.
    (binary distribution is not available currently.)
    cuStateVector is enabled by setting ``device='GPU'`` and 
    ``cuStateVec_threshold`` options. cuStateVec is enabled when number of
    qubits of input circuit is equal or greater than ``cuStateVec_threshold``.
