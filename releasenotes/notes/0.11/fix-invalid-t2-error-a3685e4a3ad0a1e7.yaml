    Fixes a bug in ``NoiseModel.from_backend()`` that raised an error when
    T2 value greater than 2 * T1 was supplied by the backend.
    After this fix, it becomes to truncate T2 value up to 2 * T1 and
    issue a user warning if truncates.
    The bug was introduced at #1391 and, before that, ``NoiseModel.from_backend()`` had
    truncated the T2 value up to 2 * T1 silently.

    See `Issue 1464 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-aer/issues/1464>`__
    for details.
