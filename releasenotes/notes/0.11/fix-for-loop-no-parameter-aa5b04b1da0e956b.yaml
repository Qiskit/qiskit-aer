    Fixed simulation of ``for`` loops where the loop parameter was not used in
    the body of the loop.  For example, previously this code would fail, but
    will now succeed:

    .. code-block:: python

        import qiskit
        from qiskit_aer import AerSimulator

        qc = qiskit.QuantumCircuit(2)
        with qc.for_loop(range(4)) as i:
            qc.h(0)
            qc.cx(0, 1)

        AerSimulator(method="statevector").run(qc)
