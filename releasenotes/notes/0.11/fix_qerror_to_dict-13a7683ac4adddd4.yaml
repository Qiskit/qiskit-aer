    Fixes a bug in :meth:`.QuantumError.to_dict` where N-qubit circuit
    instructions where the assembled instruction always applied to
    qubits ``[0, ..., N-1]`` rather than the instruction qubits. This
    bug also affected device and fake backend noise models.

    See `Issue 1415 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-aer/issues/1415>`__
    for details.
