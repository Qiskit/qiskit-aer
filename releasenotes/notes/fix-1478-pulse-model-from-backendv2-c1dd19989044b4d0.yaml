    Added support for ``BackendV2`` to
    :meth:`~qiskit.providers.aer.pulse.PulseSystemModel.from_backend`.
    Now `PulseSystemModel`` can be generated from a ``BackendV2``,
    which has custom attributes ``hamiltonian`` and ``u_channel_lo``.
    Those attributes should store values in the same format as
    those in :meth:`BackendV1.configuration`.
