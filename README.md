**Qiskit** is an open-source framework for working with noisy intermediate-scale quantum computers (NISQ) at the level of pulses, circuits, and algorithms.

Qiskit is made up of elements that each work together to enable quantum computing. This element is **Aer**, which provides high-performance quantum computing simulators with realistic noise models.

## Installation

We encourage installing Qiskit via the PIP tool (a python package manager), which installs all Qiskit elements, including this one.

```bash
pip install qiskit
```

PIP will handle all dependencies automatically for us and you will always install the latest (and well-tested) version.

To install from source, follow the instructions in the [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-aer/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Simulating your first quantum program with Qiskit Aer
Now that you have Qiskit Aer installed, you can start simulating quantum circuits with noise. Here is a basic example:

```
$ python
```

```python
from qiskit import QuantumRegister, ClassicalRegister, QuantumCircuit, execute
from qiskit import Aer, IBMQ  # import the Aer and IBMQ providers
from qiskit.providers.aer import noise  # import Aer noise models

# Choose a real device to simulate
IBMQ.load_accounts()
device = IBMQ.get_backend('ibmq_16_melbourne')
properties = device.properties()
coupling_map = device.configuration().coupling_map

# Generate an Aer noise model for device
noise_model = noise.device.basic_device_noise_model(properties)
basis_gates = noise_model.basis_gates

# Generate a quantum circuit
q = QuantumRegister(2)
c = ClassicalRegister(2)
qc = QuantumCircuit(q, c)

qc.h(q[0])
qc.cx(q[0], q[1])
qc.measure(q, c)

# Perform noisy simulation
backend = Aer.get_backend('qasm_simulator')
job_sim = execute(qc, backend,
                  coupling_map=coupling_map,
                  noise_model=noise_model,
                  basis_gates=basis_gates)
sim_result = job_sim.result()

print(sim_result.get_counts(qc))
```

```python
{'11': 412, '00': 379, '10': 117, '01': 116}
```
