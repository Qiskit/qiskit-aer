"""Noise module for Qiskit Aer.

This module contains classes and functions to build a noise model for
simulating a Qiskit quantum circuit in the presence of errors.

Noise Models
------------
Noise models for a noisy simulator are represented using the `NoiseModel`
class. This can be used to generate a custom noise model, or an automatic
noise model can be generated for a device using built in functions.

Automatically Generated Noise Models
------------------------------------
Approximate noise models for a hardware device can be generated from the
device properties using the functions from the `device` submodule.

   Basic device noise model
   ------------------------
   Generates a noise mode based on 1 and 2 qubit gate errors consisting of
   a depolarizing error followed by a thermal relaxation error, and readout
   errors on measurement outcomes. The error parameters are tuned for each
   individual qubit based on the T_1, T_2, frequency and readout error
   parameters for each qubit, and the gate error and gate time parameters
   for each gate obtained from the device backend properties.

Custom Noise Models
-------------------
Custom noise models may be constructed by adding errors to a NoiseModel
object. Errors are represented using by the `QuantumError` and
`ReadoutError` classes from the `noise.errors` module:

   Quantum errors
   --------------
   Errors that affect the quantum state during a simulation. They may be
   applied after specific circuit gates or reset operations, or before
   measure operations of qubits.

   ReadoutError
   ------------
   Errors that apply to classical bit registers after a measurement. They
   do not change the quantum state of the system, only the recorded
   classical measurement outcome.

Helper functions exist for generating standard quantum error channels in
the `noise.errors` module. These allow simple generation of the follow
canonical types of quantum errors:

   Kraus error
   Mixed unitary error
   Coherent unitary error
   Pauli error
   Depolarizing error
   Reset error
   Thermal relaxation error
   Amplitude damping error
   Phase damping error
   Combined phase and amplitude damping error
