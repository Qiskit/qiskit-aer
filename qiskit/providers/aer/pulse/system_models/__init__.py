"""Models of 'systems', which correspond roughly to things defined on tensor product
systems, e.g. Hamiltonian and matrix DEs. At the time of writing, these are meant to be mostly
descriptive classes, allowing easy construction and modification of
Hamiltonians, noise models, and differential equations.
