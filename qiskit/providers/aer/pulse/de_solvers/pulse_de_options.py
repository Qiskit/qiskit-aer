class OPoptions():
    """
    Class of options for opsolver.  Options can be specified either as
    arguments to the constructor::

        opts = Options(order=10, ...)

    or by changing the class attributes after creation::

        opts = Options()
        opts.order = 10

    Returns options class to be used as options in evolution solvers.

    Attributes:
        atol (float, 1e-8): Absolute tolerance.
        rtol (float, 1e-/6): Relative tolerance.
        method (str, 'adams'): Integration method, 'adams' or 'bdf'.
        order (int, 12): Order of integrator (<=12 'adams', <=5 'bdf').
        nsteps (int, 50000): Max. number of internal steps per time interval.
        first_step (float, 0): Size of initial step (0 = automatic).
        min_step (float, 0): Minimum step size (0 = automatic).
        max_step (float, 0): Maximum step size (0 = automatic)
        num_cpus (int): Number of cpus used by mcsolver (default = # of cpus).
        norm_tol (float, 1e-3): Tolerance used when finding wavefunction norm.
        norm_steps (int, 5): Max. number of steps used to find wavefunction norm
                            to within norm_tol
        shots (int, 1024): Number of shots to run.
        rhs_reuse (bool, False): Reuse RHS compiled function.
        rhs_filename (str): Name of compiled Cython module.
        seeds (ndarray, None): Array containing random number seeds for
                                repeatible shots.
        reuse_seeds (bool, False): Reuse seeds, if already generated.
        store_final_state (bool, False): Whether or not to store the final state
                                        of the evolution.
