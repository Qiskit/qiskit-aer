Snapshots
=========

.. deprecated:: 0.9.0

    Adding nonlocal noise to a noise model is deprecated as of qiskit-aer
    0.9.0 and will be removed no earlier than 3 months from that release date.
    They have been superceded by the save instructions in the
    :mod:`qiskit.providers.aer.library` module.

Snapshot instructions allow taking a snapshot of the current state of the
simulator without effecting the outcome of the simulation. These can be
used with the `QasmSimulator` backend to return the expectation value of
an operator or the probability of measurement outcomes.
